# Highlight of Feature
I was managed to fetch "Now Playing Movie" from Now Playing Api. It also including the pagination for scrolling the next movie

#Detail Instruction
- On terminal, cd to the project folder
- use "pod install"
- when installing pod done, you can click MovieBrowser.xcworkspace , it's the with the white icon
- after project done opening, you can try to run it on simulator

#What Incomplete
- Search: The implementation is done, but there was a problem on calling the api and always fail to decode. I can't manage to fix that issue due to time constraint. The challange is, response from the Now playing movie, and search is different. But it's still able to accomplish with some logic there.
- Favorite: I haven't manage to make it yet.
